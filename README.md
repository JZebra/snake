###Snake

The classic Nokia phone game remade with javascript and ASCII characters.

####Functionality

- Simple controls for snake movement
- Collision detection with walls and tail
- Eating apples increases score and length of snake
- The player can restart and try for a higher score


####To do

- Network play between two players
- Use HTML5 canvas to add styling (CSS would also work, but is less preferable)
- Special apples can spawn that have a time limit but are worth more points.
